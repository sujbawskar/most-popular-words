# Cmd - Streaming Text Service

## Goal
Write a Go program that reads from the given text file on disk and outputs the top 100 word occurrences with count.

### Constraints
- The file will be UTF-8 encoded plain text.
- The file size may be upwards of 1GB.
- All state should be kept in memory or on disk.
- No external services or libraries should be used.

### What we're looking for
- Clean, efficient, and tested code.
- Idiomatic use of Go.
- Understandable concurrency patterns.
- Readable documentation/comments.

### Nice to haves
- CI running tests.
- Docker build process.

## Submission
- Create a private GitHub repo containing all of the code and resources needed to run and test your application.
- Grant the following users read access:
  - dan-bond-cmd
  - daniel-almeida-cmd
  - rodrigo-araujo-cmd
- In order to review your application, the only commands we should need to execute are `make run` and `make test`. Feel free to edit the included `Makefile` if you so wish.
